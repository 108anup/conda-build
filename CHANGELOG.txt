2014-XX-XX   1.3.0:
-------------------
  * Add skeleton for CPAN Perl packages, issue #53. Unlike
    the PyPI skeleton, it supports a --recursive option to
    also generate the recipes for all of the dependencies of
    a given module/distribution.
  * Add support for run_test.pl and Perl import tests when
    building Perl packages. 
  * Add CONDA_PERL environment variable support for
    determining which version of Perl to build packages for.
    Unlike CONDA_PY, this must include the full version with
    periods (e.g., 5.18.2).
  * Automatically build packages for dependencies if the recipe is
    present in the current working directory
  * Fix a number of Python 3 compatibility issues, issue #59
  * Work with source files with uppercase suffixes
  * Switch to from chrpath to patchelf on Linux, issue #57
  * Don't use hard-coded msvc path
  * Sort import tests from skeleton pypi

2014-02-06   1.1.0:

    expects the full path to the recipe
  * Export PKG Build Number
  * Add pre-link to package, when it is found in recipe
  * Allow to add run_test.sh or run_test.bat, which will be run automatically
    during the test phase.
  * Test commands from the test/commands section of meta.yaml are run from
    bash on Linux and OS X and batch on Windows (previously they were run
    using Python's subprocess).
  * All environment variables from the build process are available during the
    tests, except with the build prefix replaced with the test prefix.
