Conda-build Documentation
=========================

Building a conda package requires
:doc:`installing conda-build <source/install-conda-build>` and
creating a conda :doc:`recipe <../source/concepts/recipe>`.
Use the ``conda build`` command to build the conda package
from the conda recipe.

You can build conda packages from a variety of source code
projects, most notably Python. For help packing a Python project,
see the `Setuptools
documentation <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

OPTIONAL: If you are planning to upload your packages to
Anaconda Cloud, you will need an
`Anaconda Cloud <http://anaconda.org>`_ account and client.
